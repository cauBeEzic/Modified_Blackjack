# Modified_Blackjack
General rules of the game:
1. It would be a 2-player game: a user/player and a computer auto-player.
2. 1 single deck of cards (52 cards) will be used in each round of play.
3. Each player can have a maximum of 5 cards (called a hand) in a round, drawing 1 card 
in each of the 5 turns in a round. The player can also decide to skip a turn and not 
have any card in that turn.
4. The cards have points associated with them: starting from 1 to 13 where Jack, Queen 
and King are treated as 11, 12 and 13 respectively.
5. The player with the hand with points closest to 33 will win. 
6. Any player goes beyond 33 is treated as the looser of that round

The Game features:
- when a player gets over 33 points, that round is over immediately; no need to play for 
whole 5 turns in a round.
- the game should keep a score for the players winning each round. The scores will be 
visible in the interface.
- After each round, it would ask the user if wants to continue or not.

The Coding/Design Requirement:
- You must follow and implement the Object-oriented paradigm (different classes, 
methods calling each other, objects passing etc.)
- Avoid repetition of code; (for example, winning condition is same for both players; you 
should not write the same code twice for each player)
- You must also apply Exception Handling in appropriate places.
- In your demonstration, you should also show the UML diagram and explain the 
relationships among the different classes you have created for this project.
